    <h1>The Greatest (worst) Plan Ever...</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>The weekend of November 9-10, 2024: K-State hosts a hackathon, and CTEC Orion competes at the Schlagle FTC regional</p>
      <p>Our heroes (idiots) decide that they must compete in both, despite having no experience in either. Their greatest enemyâ€”Sleep. They must work from 6 pm Friday, to 6 am Saturday,
        then drive 2 hours to compete at their first FTC regionals. Then, they must return to Manhattan and finish their app before judging at 9 am the next day.</p>

      <h1>The Game</h1>
      <p>Chirality essentially means 'mirror-image, non-superimposable molecules'. We decided that making a quiz/study game on the Oculus Quest 2, which would allow the student to
        see the molecule in 3D, instead of on paper, and move it around would be our project.</p>

      <h1>FTC Week 1, Schagle</h1>
      <p>At a regional event, your average group of idiots is expected to compete against groups of other idiots, playing a total of 6 matches.
        In this case, that meant that 14 matches were played in total, and that there were morning and midday sessions, both ranked within the same leaderboard.
        Our teams goal was to win as many matches as possible, while scoring as many points as possible in Auto and TeleOp, which served as tiebreakers later down the line. </p>
