    <h1>Science Olympiad</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>This was my first year in Science Olympiad, but I decided to join because a friend told me it didn't interfere with
        robotics for once. I joined Robot Tour and Electric Vehicle (EV) because both events played into my interests of 3d printing,
        electronics and programming. The goal of EV is to have your robot drive a distance between 7 and 10 meters as quickly and accurately
        as possible. Robot tour required a robot that was able to be programmed at the event to navigate a maze.
        V1 of both competed at regionals, and both qualified for state. To prepare for state I redesigned
        both events. I focused on reducing weight for EV while improving consistency, and I moved to a 4 motor design with
        room for encoders for Robot Tour. State is on April 5th-6th, so I will update how things went after that.
